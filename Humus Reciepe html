  This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from 
  a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.
  Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. 
  It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.</body>

<h2>   Ingredients</h2>
<ol> 
 <li> 1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>
 <li> 175g of tahini</li> 
  <li>6 sundried tomatoes </li>
  <li> Half a red pepper </li>
 <li> A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>  
  <li> 1 clove of garlic</li> 
  <li>A dash of olive oil </li>
</ol>

<h3> Instructions</h3>
<body>  For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, 
	lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.</body>
<h4>  Storage</h4>
<body>  Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.

  Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</body>
